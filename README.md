# The-Four-Guineas

## Goal
I was interested in exploring the geographical, cultural and economic similarities between Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea and Papua New Guinea, four countires that share the same name. I conducted reseach and placed my findings in this medium [article](url). In order to bolster the piece, I included some visualizations of a few economic indicators comparing each country. I utilised public datasets made available by the United Nations and the IMF.

## Key Insights  
- **Papua New Guinea** is the wealthiest of the four with a GDP of $31 billion but faces a human capital crisis.  
- **Guinea-Bissau** is the poorest, heavily reliant on cashew exports and vulnerable to global price fluctuations.  
- **Equatorial Guinea** has significant oil wealth but suffers from wealth inequality and poor human development indicators.  
- **Guinea ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡³** plays a key role in regional stability but struggles with political and economic challenges.

## Tools
- Excel: Used to clean and rearrange data points in the CSV files, creating features necessary for generating the desired visualizations.
- PowerBi: The cleaned data was then imported to PowerBi for visualization
